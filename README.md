## GetRScript V 0.207 for Windows

Desktop application developed with the Java language and the JavaFX library.
This application aims to access Google's Gemini AI with a specific prompt engineering so that it can generate scripts for the R programming language.
The user of this application will be able to request the generation of graphs, data transformation, generation of maps, creation of web applications, etc. from Google's Gemini AI and, when possible, it will respond in a script in the R language.
With GetRScript you can run your R scripts or those generated by AI directly from the chat to an R console.

### GetScript subfolders and files

When GetRScript is installed and run for the first time, a subfolder will be created in the user's Documents folder named GetRScript. This will contain the _**wd**_ (workspace) subfolder, which will be the R workspace. This will also contain the _**getrscript.db**_ file, where the application's chats and settings will be stored.
