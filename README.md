Desktop application developed with the Java language and the JavaFX library.
This application aims to access Google's Gemini AI with a specific prompt engineering so that it can generate scripts for the R programming language.
The user of this application will be able to request the generation of graphs, data transformation, generation of maps, creation of web applications, etc. from Google's Gemini AI and, when possible, it will respond in a script in the R language.
With GetRScript you can run your R scripts or those generated by AI directly from the chat to an R console.

### GetScript subfolders and files

When GetRScript is installed and run for the first time, a subfolder will be created in the user's _**Documents**_ folder named GetRScript. This will contain the _**wd**_ (workspace) subfolder, which will be the R workspace. This will also contain the _**getrscript.db**_ file, where the application's chats and settings will be stored.

It is through the Prompt form that you can send messages to the AI, along with small files if you prefer. In the chat, the AI's response may or may not contain a frame with the requested R script. At the bottom of this frame there will be two buttons: one to open the R Console form with the R script and another to copy the script to the clipboard.

In the R console, you can run the R script generated by the AI ​​by clicking the _**Run**_ button. The result of running an R script is an image, a graph, an HTML file, a PDF file or a web service address will be displayed using the default media configured in the operating system. Every file generated when running an R script will be in the  _**wd**_ folder. Every file referenced in an R script must be in the  _**wd**_ folder.
